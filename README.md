The project AirBnB is about creating a mini-console.
The console can work as an interactive or non-interactive mode.

Command line interpreter: A command line interpreter (CLI), also known as a command shell or terminal, is a program that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system by typing commands into a text-based interface. The CLI interprets these commands and executes the corresponding actions.

HOW TO START A COMMAND LINE: type the following command ./console.py

HOW TO USE IT: manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit

EXAMPLE: 
cd: Change the current working directory
dir 
ls: List the files and directories in the current working directory
mkdir: Create a new directory
echo: Display text on the screen
type or cat: Display the contents of a file
copy or cp: Copy a file from one location to another
